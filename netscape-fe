# Commentary:

# Front-end shell script for Mozilla, used to
# manage multiple versions of netscape.

# Strategy: Install this script as "$prefix/netscape".
# This is what users should normally execute to run "netscape".

# Give each version of Mozilla a separate hierarchy under
# "$prefix", with the name "netscape-NN.NN" where NN.NN is the version number.
# This script looks at what versions are available, and selects a version,
# currently $DEFAULTVERSION.

# However, users can specify their own choice to force the selection of a
# particular version by setting the environment variable MOZVERSION to have
# a value which is the version number of the netscape that they want to use
# (just the numeric value), or to specify either the NEWEST or OLDEST
# versions.

# Code:

# Name by which this script was invoked.
progname=`echo "$0" | sed -e 's/[^\/]*\///g'`

# To prevent hairy quoting and escaping later.
bq='`'
eq="'"

DEFAULTVERSION="${DEFAULTVERSION-NEWEST}"

  exit 1

mozprefix="$prefix/netscape-"

# Find out which versions are available on the system and sort them
# in numeric order.
#
# The largish sed script prefixes all version numbers with a sort key.
# That key is constructed by padding out any single or double digits to 3
# digits from the version number, then converting all occurences of `.' to
# `0', and prefixing and suffixing the entire result with an additional
# zero.  After sorting, the sort key is stripped from the output.
# We do all this because `sort' cannot numerically sort decimal numbers and
# will stop on the first `.'.
# This may not work correctly if the version number has more than 4 levels
# of minor versions (e.g. "1.2.3.4.5" may cause problems).
