# Commentary:

# This program determines whether the stack grows from lower
# addresses to higher addresses, or vice-versa.

# The C compiler is called by this shell script.  The environment variable
# `CC' and `CFLAGS' are used to determine exactly what compiler and args to
# use.  `cc' is the default.

# Code:

cd /tmp || exit 1
file="stackdir$$"
trap 'rm -f "$file" "${file}".[acos]' 0 1 2 3 15

{
  echo 'int sub (char *a) { char b; return (&b < a); }'
  echo 'int main () { char a; return sub (&a); }'
} > "${file}.c"

${CC-cc} $CFLAGS "${file}.c" -o "./$file" || exit 1

./"$file"

case $? in
   0) echo "up"      ;;
   1) echo "down"    ;;
   *) echo "unknown" ;;
esac

# eof
