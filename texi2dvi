# bourne shell constructs were avoided because they weren't guaranteed to
# be available in some earlier implementations.  I've tried to make this as
# portable as possible. 
#
# Among the more interesting lossages I noticed with some bourne shells
# are:
#       1) Some don't have an `unset' builtin 
#       2) In some implementations the `shift' builtin can't take a
#          numerical argument.
